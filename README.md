<h1>Pick A Dish</h1>
<br>
First Project: <i>User-Centric Frontend Development</i>

My project is a static frontpage website aimed at people who have the ingredients available but have no idea what to do with them.
So for example if you have some lettuce in the fridge and some chicken in the freezer and you have no idea what to make then you can input salad as a starter then chicken as a main and a random recipe will show that you can use or
define more of the ingredients to make a more narrowed search.
Also it will have recipes of the day that will alternate daily.

<h2>UX</h2>
<br>
This website is mainly focused on users who are wanting a variety of meals with little thinking about what meal specifically. This allows for a more varied and open palette with different foods and flavours then they would have if they 
went through a book or other site as they are generally structured in a way that makes the user need a meal idea in mind.
I think this site would be very used as users now want to have variety and speed with little thinking on there end.

<ul>
<li><b>User 1:</b> I want a quick meal using some chicken and a pepper I have in my fridge, I input chicken and pepper in the main and have a recipe appear that uses these ingredients with little thought on my part.</li>
<li><b>User 2:</b> I am having guests around and would like a starter, main and dessert but dont know what will go well together, I input seafood in starter as that is one ingredient I am using and select option "similar" for mains and dessert, 
then I am offered a main dish of fish for example and a dessert like macarons which if I havent got the ingredients for I can use as a basis for selecting a new recipe.</li>
<li><b>User 3:</b> I have a dish I do alot but would like a different take on it so I input the specific recipe and can click on option "similar" but only for mains which shows me my dish but using a different main ingredient.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wireframes/Designs</h4>
They can be found in the folder /wireframes.

<h2>Features</h2>
<br>
The first part the user sees is a nice clean, minimal design with an enticing picture of a dish with a minimal designed Logo and name.
The second part the user sees is the navigation bar which is again designed to be minimal with enough information to let the user know what it does.
The next part would be a brief description of the site and what it does followed by a selection of "dishes of the day" which give an quick idea incase of time constraints of the user.
The next part would likely be the Starter, Main and/or Dessert sections which is designed to focus on the selection box with a very little to distract the user.
The final part would be the footer which houses the T&C, an about/bio section with mentions if needed and social media links.

I would like to host a live/recorded cook-along with different people able to upload or livestream themselfs cooking to allow people to go along at home with it.
I would also like a kids cooking section that allows people to get there kids to help with the dishes or with other parts of the meals.

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>
<br>
Interactive diagram/picture with selectable food items to allow for a more visual approach.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<br>
<li><b>HTML5</b></li>
<li><b>CSS</b></li>
<li><b>Bootstrap</b> (4.3.1)</li>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<br>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

<h2>Contact form:</h2>
Go to the <i>"Contact Us"<i> page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<br>
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

I received inspiration for this project from the many food websites and cooking shows, also sometimes from my own lack of imagination with coming up with meal ideas for a family.
